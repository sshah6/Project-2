# Health Code
            Health Code is a company that will ensure you can keep your personal health in tact, while dealing with 
        the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Information such as vaccine history or your last checkup may not seem 
        overly important, but without it we subject ourselves to uninformed professionals, resulting in questionable 
        medical procedures. With Health Code you can keep all your health information at your finger tips, including, 
        but not limited to, setting up new appointments and a list of medications you are allergic to. Here at Health Code
        we strive to minimize the amount of medical mixups, regardless of how serious or trivial they may be.
